## Description

As A User, I will initially be taken to a page with an option to login or signup. Once logged into my account, I can see my list of ufc fighters in my library of fighters. Users can also access each individual fighter that is in their library on a seperate page. 

Each fighter in a users library can be edited & updated. There will also be an option to add new fighters as well as delete current fighters.
